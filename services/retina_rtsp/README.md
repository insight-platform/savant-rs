# Retina RTSP Adapter

Retina RTSP is a new generation Savant RTSP adapter built around Scott Lamb's [Retina](https://github.com/scottlamb/retina) project. This adapter supports multiple RTSP streams and RTSP synchronization with RTCP sender reports. It is not as capable as the FFmpeg-based RTSP adapter which potentially supports more cameras but provides its own unique features.
