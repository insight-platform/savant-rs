# Router

Router is a Python-extendable service which can process/modify and route Savant messages based on their labels. With the router you can process multiple ingress streams coming from multiple sockets and route them to multiple egress streams. This service is crucial for complex streaming applications requiring conditionally processing streams with many circuits.
