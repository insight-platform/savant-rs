Installation And Configuration
==============================

Software Requirements
---------------------

Prebuilt Replay packages are distributed as Docker images, so regardless of the platform and OS distributive, you need to have Docker installed on your system.

If you do not want to run Replay in Docker, you can build it from source or contact us for building binaries for your platform.

Docker Images for ARM64 and X86_64 are available on GitHub Container Registry:

- `replay-x86 <https://github.com/insight-platform/Replay/pkgs/container/replay-x86>`_ - for X86_64 CPUs;
- `replay-arm64 <https://github.com/insight-platform/Replay/pkgs/container/replay-arm64>`_ - for ARM64 CPUs.

Quick Installation
------------------

To run Replay in Docker, you can use the following command:

X86_64:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run -it --rm \
      --network host \
      -v $(pwd)/data:/opt/rocksdb \
      ghcr.io/insight-platform/replay-x86:main


ARM64:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run -it --rm \
      --network host \
      -v $(pwd)/data:/opt/rocksdb \
      ghcr.io/insight-platform/replay-arm64:main


The service will use the default configuration file and store data in the ``data`` directory on the host machine.

Instead of the ``main`` tag you can use the specific version of the image, e.g. ``v0.1.1``. Refer to the `GitHub Container Registry <https://github.com/orgs/insight-platform/packages?repo_name=Replay>`_ for the list of available tags.

Environment Variables
---------------------

Only one mandatory environment variable is required to configure Replay in Docker:

- ``RUST_LOG`` - sets the log level for the service. The default value is ``info``. You can use ``debug`` or ``trace`` for more detailed logs. Also, you can change log level for a particular scope.

You can also use optional environment variables in the configuration file. Refer to the `Configuration Parameters <#configuration-parameters>`_ section for more details.

Ports
-----

Replay uses the following ports:

- ``8080`` - the port for the REST API;
- ``5555`` - the port for ingress data (Savant ZeroMQ protocol).

If the service is deployed as a dead-end consumer, you do not need to use any other ports. Nevertheless, depending on the configuration file, you may need have an extra port opened for egress, when the service is deployed as intermediate node as depicted in the next image:

.. image:: ../_static/replay_usage_diagram.png

Configuration File
-------------------

The configuration file is a JSON file that contains the following parameters:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "common": {
        "pass_metadata_only": false,
        "management_port": 8080,
        "stats_period": {
          "secs": 60,
          "nanos": 0
        },

        "job_writer_cache_ttl": {
          "secs": 60,
          "nanos": 0
        },
        "job_eviction_ttl": {
          "secs": 60,
          "nanos": 0
        }
      },
      "in_stream": {
        "url": "router+bind:tcp://0.0.0.0:5555",
        "receive_timeout": {
          "secs": 1,
          "nanos": 0
        },
        "receive_hwm": 1000,
        "topic_prefix_spec": {
          "none": null
        },
        "source_cache_size": 1000,
        "inflight_ops": 100
      },
      "out_stream": {
        "url": "pub+bind:tcp://0.0.0.0:5556",
        "send_timeout": {
          "secs": 1,
          "nanos": 0
        },
        "send_retries": 3,
        "receive_timeout": {
          "secs": 1,
          "nanos": 0
        },
        "receive_retries": 3,
        "send_hwm": 1000,
        "receive_hwm": 100,
        "inflight_ops": 100
      },
      "storage": {
        "rocksdb": {
          "path": "${DB_PATH:-/tmp/rocksdb}",
          "data_expiration_ttl": {
            "secs": 60,
            "nanos": 0
          }
        }
      }
    }

The above-mentioned configuration file is used by default, when you launch Replay without specifying the configuration file. You can override the default configuration by providing your own configuration file and specifying it in the launch command:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run -it --rm \
      --network host \
      -v $(pwd)/data:/opt/rocksdb \
      -v $(pwd)/config.json:/opt/config.json \
      ghcr.io/insight-platform/replay-x86:main /opt/config.json

Environment Variables in Configuration File
-------------------------------------------

You can use environment variables in the configuration file. The syntax is ``${VAR_NAME:-default_value}``. If the environment variable is not set, the default value will be used.

Deployment Best Practices
-------------------------

When you deploy Replay as a terminal node, the service bottlenecks are mostly related to the underlying storage. You can use any type of communication socket like ``sub``, ``router``, ``rep`` as long as your storage keeps up with the load. The default configuration is OK for most cases.

When you deploy Replay as an intermediate node, the service can experience bottlenecks related to the downstream nodes. Thus we recommend placing a buffer adapter between Replay and the next node, if the next node can experience performance drops. Such situations may require careful maintenance and configuration modification, so using a `buffer adapter <https://docs.savant-ai.io/develop/savant_101/10_adapters.html#buffer-bridge-adapter>`_ is a failsafe option.

This is also a "must go" option when the downstream node can reload or experience network unavailability.
