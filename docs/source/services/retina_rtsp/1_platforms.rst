Hardware Requirements
=====================

CPU
---

Currently, we support two platforms:

- ARM64 (Nvidia Jetson, Raspberry Pi 4/5, AWS Graviton, etc);
- X86_64 (Intel/AMD CPUs).

RAM
---

The system uses needs a very small amount of RAM. We recommend having at least 1GB of RAM. However, you should be able to run Replay even with 512MB of RAM without problems.

Storage
-------

The service does not require storage aside of the space required to store docker images and container layers. 2 GB of storage is enough.
